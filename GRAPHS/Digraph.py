"""
The Digraph class represents a directed graph of vertices
named 0 through V - 1.
It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the digraph,
iterate over all of the vertices adjacent from a given vertex.
Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.

This implementation uses a list of lists representation, which 
is a vertex-indexed array of lists.
All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except
iterating over the vertices adjacent from a given vertex, which takes
time proportional to the number of such vertices.
