"""
The Graph class represents an undirected graph of vertices
named 0 through V â€“ 1.
It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph,
iterate over all of the vertices adjacent to a vertex. It also provides
methods for returning the number of vertices V and the number
of edges E. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
By convention, a self-loop v-v appears in the
adjacency list of v twice and contributes two to the degree
of v.

This implementation uses an list of lists representation, which 
is a vertex-indexed list of lists.
All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except
iterating over the vertices adjacent to a given vertex, which takes
time proportional to the number of such vertices.
